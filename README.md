A fun little API-focused project centered around the International Space Station. Provided are a livestream from the station itself, location data (teneuously and cantancorously) provided by Google's map API and 'Where the ISS at'(https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer), and roster data provided by corquaid(https://github.com/corquaid/international-space-station-APIs).

Known issues (as of latest update, 3/9/2023):
-Google Maps API doesn't always update with the provided props from Main.js on page load
-Google Maps API also doesn't wish to cooperate with live updating of the ISS position
